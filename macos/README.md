## Getting Started

I've tried to set up a simple entry point script that can be run daily to keep things in check but also be able to configure a new machine.

```sh
./run.sh
```

### Breakdown

## Brew

[Homebrew](http://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew) is used for installing dependencies on my machine. [Brew bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) is used for keeping all my dependencies in one Brewfile.
